# PHP Server Status

## What's In This Project

With this project, you can instantly see the service status of the server and the amount of usage of basic units such as ram, storage, and processor. The project consists of two parts: API and Web page. Since the project is prepared according to the desired situations during an interview, API requests and returns are processed with the Morse alphabet. Likewise, the Web page creates the image from the data sent with the morse alphabet it receives from the API. Updates will be made over time to make this optional.

### Framework
The project was prepared with CodeIgniter 4.

### PHP Version
PHP 8.1.4
